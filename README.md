# Sandbox

A lightweight playground of small projects auto-generated by my custom **My Cursor** application.  
**Tool repo:** https://github.com/adityamishra9/my-cursor

> This repository is intentionally general-purpose: new folders appear as the tool spins up experiments (HTML/CSS/JS today; frameworks/apps later). Each project is isolated in its own subfolder.

## 🚀 How to run things quickly

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS projects**: open `index.html` in your browser (or use any static server).
- **Node/Framework projects** (when they appear): check that folder’s `README.md` or `package.json` for scripts like `dev`, `start`, or `build`.

---

## 🧭 Folder conventions

- Each project lives in its **own subfolder**.
- Keep project-specific assets inside that folder.
- Add a tiny `README.md` to any non-trivial project (what it is, how to run it).

## 🔐 Notes on secrets & API keys

Some auto-generated demos may include placeholder keys for replication.  
**Do not** treat them as production credentials. Replace with your own keys and keep secrets out of version control whenever possible.

## 📜 License / reuse

This sandbox is for personal experiments. Individual subfolders may include their own licenses or notices; **when in doubt, ask before reusing**.
